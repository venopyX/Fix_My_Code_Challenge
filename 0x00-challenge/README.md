# 0x00 Fix My Code Challenge

Welcome to the **Fix My Code Challenge** repository! This project is part of the ALX Africa Intranet curriculum, where the goal is to debug and fix existing code bases. The challenge is designed to improve your problem-solving and debugging skills.

## Project Overview

This project consists of several tasks, each involving a different programming language. The objective is to identify and fix the issues in the provided code without rewriting everything from scratch.

### Tasks

1. **FizzBuzz (Python)**
   - **File:** `0-fizzbuzz.py`
   - **Description:** Fix the implementation of the FizzBuzz algorithm. The current code does not print "FizzBuzz" for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5.

2. **Print Square (JavaScript)**
   - **File:** `1-print_square.js`
   - **Description:** Correct the function to print a square of a given size. The current implementation does not produce the expected output for larger sizes.

3. **Sort (Ruby)**
   - **File:** `2-sort.rb`
   - **Description:** Debug the sorting algorithm to correctly sort a list of arguments. The current code does not sort the numbers as expected.

4. **User Password (Python)**
   - **File:** `3-user.py`
   - **Description:** Fix the `User` class implementation to ensure the `is_valid_password` method works correctly.

5. **Double Linked List (C)**
   - **Directory:** `4-delete_dnodeint/`
   - **Description:** Debug the implementation of a double linked list. The current code does not correctly delete nodes at specified indices.

## Requirements

- **Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **OS:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Coding Standards:** All files should end with a new line.
- **Documentation:** A `README.md` file is mandatory at the root of the project folder.

## Getting Started

1. Codes to fix:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alx-tools/0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge/tree/master
